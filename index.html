    <p>We are trying to research and develop technologies using IoT,Image Processing and Machine Learning for Environment, Health and Industrial Purpose.  
We make extensive use of Open source Hardware, Computer Vision techniques in our studies.</p>

<p>We have developed several different instruments for imaging the human retina at a cellular scale.  One class of instrument uses adaptive optics to correct the temporally varying, higher-order aberrations of the eye.  Another class of instrument uses interferometry to detect faint reflections from cells that would otherwise make them invisible in the living eye. These instruments have been used to study normal and diseased retinas and optic nerves.</p>

<h4><a href="research/psychophysics">Cyber physical System</a></h4>
<p>We research and develop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for Environment, Manufacturing, Health Care and Robotics applications. Our models
usually comprise of these three elements: physical hardware(embedded system), network(wireless) and computations(cloud). </p>

<p>The color appearance of our environment generally remains relatively stable despite changes in context (e.g, due to illumination changes). This phenomenon is known as color constancy. Most research has tended to focus on short-term adaptation where recovery is fairly rapid. Our research focuses on changes in vision and perception across the life span.</p>
