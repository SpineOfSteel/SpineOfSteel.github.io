Areas of Interest: Computer Vision, VR, IoT, Cyber physical system, Machine Learning, Information Systems
  
  <h2>Current Research</h2>Research and develop technologies using IoT, Image Processing and Machine Learning for Environment, Health and Industrial Purpose.  
We make extensive use of Open source Hardware, Computer Vision techniques in our studies.

   
<h4><a href="#">Stereo Vision</a></h4>Like human eyes, We successfully were able to give 3D visual sense to the robots. The robot able to predict depth and recognize 3D coordinates of object. We have enclosed white paper on this with detailed analysis of result. This implementation can be seen in the video as well

<h4><a href="research/psychophysics">Machine to Machine Communication</a></h4>Machine-to-machine, or M2M, is a broad label that can be used to describe any technology that enables networked devices to exchange information and perform actions without the manual assistance of humans.

<h4><a href="#">Cyber physical System</a></h4>We research and develop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for Environment, Manufacturing, Health Care and Robotics applications. Our models
usually comprise of these three elements: physical hardware(embedded system), network(wireless) and computations(cloud).
